# Experiments

## Scenario A - Single vs. Multi-Cloud Mirroring

**Objective:** Compare cost and carbon trade-offs between single-provider and multi-cloud mirrored deployments.

**Execution:** [Command here]

**Expected Time:** [X] minutes

## Scenario B - The Pareto Frontier (Cost vs. Carbon)

**Objective:** Analyze the sensitivity of the MILP model when varying carbon caps.

**Expected Result:** A frontier showing the "Green Premium" as carbon constraints tighten.

## Scenario C - Computational Performance and Scalability
**Objective:** Measure solver execution time across varying topology complexities.
